# gambler
The Atari BASIC source code to 1982's Gambler, published by SoftSide. Modified for extra fun :)

Note that this file is encoded in ATASCII so the newline character is different, and some other characters are different as well. If you don't have an editor that can handle ATASCII, it won't be very readble. I've been editing with: https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossumur/esp_8_bit/master/atr_image_explorer.htm
